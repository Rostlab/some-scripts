# [Rostlab](http://rostlab.org/) scripts

Use this git repository to **share your scripts**. They could be useful to other Rostlab members and the general public!

The scripts don't have to be super advanced; simple & quick hacks are much welcome.

Only 3 rules for contributing your scripts:

1. Give your script files a meaningful name
2. Put some documentation/help in the header of the files so that others can know what they are for.
3. Put your author information in the header of the file.
4. Add your scripts via a pull request. (Don't directly commit them to the master branch).


For any help or doubt about using the repository, please contact [@juanmirocks](https://github.com/juanmirocks) or @sacdallago
